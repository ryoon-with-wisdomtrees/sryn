## Object

Objects are extremely important when it comes to programming especially when you start to realize that there

1. nouns, adjective = properties
2. verbs = functions

### Embedded object

object can contains objects. { {} } like this

But then what I need to do is encapsulate all of those objects and components together into one object

You may have a camera in your computer you have a screen you have a keyboard you have the trackpad.

Each of which have their own nouns and verbs associated with each component in your computer and **you can break it down and down and down and down and go as complex as you would like.**

But then what I need to do is **encapsulate all of those objects and components together into one object**

So we've understood one encapsulation.

**Encapsulation is grouping data together whether it be nouns and verbs or both.**

Then we have nouns and objectives which describe the object and verbs which are actions performed on that object and finally objects can contain other objects.

Now if you understand all of this you will understand objects and if you apply this knowledge in your everyday life then objects will become more clearer to you as a programmer.
